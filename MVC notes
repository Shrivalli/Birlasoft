Web Application:

Website is a collection of web pages - both dynamic and static  (Websites can be deployed in a webserver)
Web Application - website+logic (Web apps can be deployed in app server)

Web hosting - making the web app/ web site available over the internet for accessibility of others

Deploying(copying the build artifacts (not the source code)) the site/ application on to the webserver/Appserver others cannot access


Microsoft is providing IISExpress (Internet Information Server) - App server (to deploy our webapplications).

Three types of web applications that can be in .NET core (3 templates)
1. Webapp - website (Model+View)
2. MVC - webapplication
3. API - webapplication


Why MVC?
1. Layer of Abstraction - security
2. Seperation of Concerns - organizing the work (UI, logic, data)

Controller is a class and it inherits itself from a controller base class.
Every controller ends with the word Controller (must).

The controller class contains action methods. the action methods invokes the views inside the views folder 

For every controller there will be a folder getting created inside the view folder automatically.


Views have the extension of .cshtml (Razor pages)
view can contain two things :

1. cs - csharp code 
2. html code - 

.cshtml(both logic in c# and presentation in html format)
